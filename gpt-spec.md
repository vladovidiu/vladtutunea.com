# Overview

Create a personal website to boost your online brand, showcase your professional experience, and host a blog. The site features an interactive, scroll-driven homepage, a timeline-based Experience page, and a blog powered by MDX static files. Itâ€™s built with Remix and deployed on Vercel, with a modern, responsive design (including dark mode and a minimal hamburger menu on mobile) and social media integration.

# 1. Requirements

## Functional Requirements

- **Homepage**

  - Interactive, non-traditional layout.
  - Scroll-driven narrative with animated/morphing elements (e.g., animated grid or timeline reveals).
  - Micro-interactions (e.g., elements reacting to scroll or mouse movements).
  - Navigation via minimal header; hamburger menu for mobile.

- **Experience Page**

  - Timeline view detailing professional history.
  - Display milestones, roles, achievements, and optional multimedia (e.g., icons, images).

- **Blog**

  - Content managed as MDX static files.
  - Frontmatter fields:
    - Mandatory: `title`, `date`, `tags`, `excerpt`
    - Suggested additional: `author`, `slug`, `coverImage`, `category`
  - Features:
    - Category and tag filtering.
    - Search functionality.
    - Advanced media embedding.
  - No comment system initially.

- **Social Media Integration**
  - Include social links in footer or a dedicated section for contact.

## Non-Functional Requirements

- **Responsive Design:** Mobile-first approach with adaptive layouts.
- **Dark Mode:** Toggle available for both mobile and desktop.
- **Performance:** Smooth animations and interactions without hampering page load.
- **Accessibility:** Ensure navigation and content meet accessibility standards.
- **SEO:** Optimize page meta, structured data for blog posts, and performance best practices.

# 2. Architecture & Tech Stack

## Framework & Tools

- **Frontend Framework:** Remix
- **Content Management:** MDX static files (using libraries like `@mdx-js/react`)
- **Styling:** Modern CSS frameworks (consider TailwindCSS or a custom solution for a modern look)
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Data Handling

- **MDX Integration:**

  - Store MDX files in a designated directory (e.g., `/content/blog` and `/content/experience`).
  - Use frontmatter for metadata extraction.
  - Setup a loader in Remix to read and parse MDX files during build time.
  - Utilize caching strategies for static content (e.g., revalidate only on deploy).

- **Dynamic Routing:**
  - Implement file-based routing for blog posts (e.g., `/blog/:slug`) and experience entries.
  - Ensure fallback/error pages for non-existent routes.

---

# 3. Error Handling Strategies

- **Route-Level Error Boundaries:**

  - Implement Remix error boundaries to catch and display errors in each route.
  - Provide a friendly fallback UI for failed MDX content loads (e.g., "Content not available, please try again later").

- **Global Error Handling:**

  - Use try/catch around dynamic imports or file operations.
  - Log errors (consider integrating a logging service for production).

- **User Feedback:**
  - Display clear error messages on UI without exposing sensitive details.
  - Implement loading states for asynchronous data fetching.

---

# 4. Testing Plan

## Unit Testing

- **Components:** Use React Testing Library & Jest to test individual UI components (e.g., navigation, dark mode toggle, timeline elements).
- **MDX Parsing:** Write tests to verify that MDX content loads correctly and frontmatter fields are parsed accurately.

## Integration Testing

- **Routes:** Test Remix loaders for blog and experience routes.
- **Navigation:** Ensure that dynamic routes (e.g., blog post pages) render properly and the interactive homepage transitions work as expected.
- **Dark Mode & Responsive Behavior:** Use end-to-end tests (e.g., Cypress) to simulate user interaction across devices and verify dark mode toggle functionality.

## Accessibility & Performance

- **Accessibility:** Integrate tools like axe-core for accessibility testing.
- **Performance:** Use Lighthouse audits during development to verify performance, SEO, and accessibility.

---

# 5. Deployment & CI/CD

- **Deployment:**

  - Deploy on Vercel with automatic builds on push to main/master branch.
  - Use environment variables for any build-time configuration.

- **CI/CD:**
  - Integrate with GitHub Actions or similar for running tests (unit, integration, accessibility) on each commit.
  - Set up pre-deployment checks to ensure code quality and performance metrics meet targets.

---

# 6. Additional Considerations

- **Design & Animations:**

  - Use modern CSS animations and JavaScript libraries as needed for scroll-driven interactivity.
  - Ensure animations are performant and degrade gracefully on older devices.

- **Future Expansion:**
  - Keep the personal projects showcase as an optional module for later implementation.
  - Modular code structure to add more features (e.g., a comment system) without major refactoring.
